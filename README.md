### Skateboard REST API

In the shared mobility space, there are a number of different types of shared assets - cars, scooters, ebikes. For this project, we want to create a starting point for an API that will allow individual skateboarders to share their boards.


## Requirements
For development, you will only need Node.js and a node global package, Yarn, installed in your environement.
### Node
- #### Node installation on Windows

  Just go on [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/) and download the installer.
Also, be sure to have `git` available in your PATH, `npm` might need it (You can find git [here](https://git-scm.com/)).

- #### Node installation on Ubuntu

  You can install nodejs and npm easily with apt install, just run the following commands.

      $ sudo apt install nodejs
      $ sudo apt install npm


---

## Install
    $ git clone https://github.com/project_name/this_project
    $ npm install

## Running the project
    $ npm start
    or
    $ node ./bin/www

## Test project
    $ npm test





The goal of this project is to assess development skills suitable for a backend developer position by testing knowledge and proficiency with software design, unit testing and web technologies like HTTP and REST.

- **Project Name:** Skateboard REST API
- **Project Goal:** Create/define an API that will help skateboarders to share their 'boards'
- **Technology:** Pick any language, framework and testing framework you like
- **Deliverables:**  Fork the project into your own account. Submit a pull request on https://github.com/mbsoft/new_mob_assignments that includes your complete solution

**Description: (Note: these stories are intentionally somewhat vague)**

As a skateboard owner I want to be able to add my individual board to a skateboard sharing marketplace.

As a skateboard owner I want to be able to indicate that my board is available or unavailable for sharing

As a skateboard owner I want to be able to modify the details for the board that I share.

As a skateboard borrower, I want to see a list of available boards

**Task:** Build the REST API that might support the stories described above. Write unit tests for each component.

**Requirements:**

1. Design your API in a RESTful way and respond with JSON.
1. Make sure your code has tests.
1. Consider some form of logging
1. Write the code and design your system to be as realistic and production-ready as possible. Follow best-practices and focus on quality.
1. A skateboard might have the following attributes: name of owner, brand, weight, length, location, timestamp and any other attribution you deem necessary
1. Add endpoints that support your solution
1. Try to keep track of the time spent on the project as this might be discussed
1. Bonus points for adding any kind of front-end that can be used to visualize available boards through use of the designed APIs
some examples:

  * **Create skateboard:**

    - attributes for a board might include the photo, dimensions, specs etc.
    - To keep things simple, no authentication needs to be performed.

  * **Get skateboards**
    - perhaps based on status, spec filter etc.

  * **Update skateboard**
    - change status, add additional details/specs etc.

  * **Delete skateboard**


 ....

1. Describe your solution in a README and how to run it. Ensure that you clearly state assumptions that you made.


**Guidelines**

Please commit early and often and with good commit messages. This will allow us to see how you've approached the problem. Don't worry about changing things around often.

Be prepared to discuss some of your approaches and design decisions.

Please ask any questions if something is unclear
